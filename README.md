# Random Twitchers Play Random Games From my Nintendo Switch

### How This Works
You enter the Twitch stream, and wait in line. When you're up, a low-latency video 
connection of my Switch is streamed to your browser at an undisclosed URL. You can use a USB 
controller or your  keyboard to directly control my Nintendo Switch for a few minutes! 
When the time passes, the controls are passed to the next person in line.

The results are streamed onto Twitch. As a viewer I can see the game progress from start to 
completition; passing through the hands of people from all over the globe.

...This is how Animal Crossing should be played. 

### This is NOT typical "Twitch Plays"
Twitch Plays works by players entering in commands through Twitch Chat. The commands 
for input (A/B/Up/Down) are gathered over a window of time (say 15 seconds), and the
most commonly inputted command is relayed to the device. Kinda like an Ouji Board.

Random Twitch Plays allows for players to plug in their controller or keyboard, and assume
direct control for a period of time. Eventually the controls are passed to the next player in line.
